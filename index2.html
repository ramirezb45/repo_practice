		<h3 id="bookOpinion"> My Book Opinion</h3>
	
		<p> The books I like vary very much the three books listed as my favorites are great reads. The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham peaks my interest in finance and talks about how to think as an investor. It also teaches the reader how to look for good investments in the stock market and more. Metahuman by Deepak Chopra and The Courage to be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga gave me a different view on the world and were very eye opening books.

		<h3 id="movieOpinion"> My Movie Opinion</h3>

		<p> Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies I find it to be very endearing and heartwarming to watch. The main character definitely makes me wonder about all the genuinely nice people in the world who tend to be outshined by all the bad. The Proposal and Wedding Crashers are very entertaining comedic movies in my opinion. The Proposal isn't as crazy as the Wedding Crashers movie but it has a nice romantic aspect I enjoy. Wedding Crashers is an all around entertaining movie in my opinion no matter how many times I watch I would definitely reccomend it to everyone.

	<h3 id="tvOpinion"> My TV Show Opinion</h3>

			<p> The Office is a fantastic show. I have watched every season at least nine times. The Office really never gets old to me with the jokes and story. I think the characters really grow on you when you watch it in it's entirety. American Dad in my opinion isn't the nicest show but its enjoyable to me. I think some of the jokes can be funny but sometimes they just warrent a chuckle. Bob's Burgers is a bit of a contrast because it's more kid friendly. I think the family is more wholesome and the kids really make the show fun for me.
